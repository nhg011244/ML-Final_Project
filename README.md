Download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat from https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
I cannot upload the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file to GitHub because it's too large.
Please unzip the data.zip file to extract 4 data files related to eyes and run the program.
